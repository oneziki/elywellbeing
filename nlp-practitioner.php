                           EFT — sometimes mentioned as Energy Tapping — may be a complete bundle of
                           techniques that NLP Master Practitioner Gary Craig created. Designed to create an
                           equilibrium in the body&#39;s energy system, EFT removes the consequences of
                           obstructive emotions, physical pain, and addictive cravings, like those from
                           cigarettes, alcohol and medicines. EFT is predicated on an equivalent scientifically
                           proven principles as acupuncture but is straightforward to apply by only tapping on
                           parts of your body. This is often an incredible tool to use and show to your clients for
                           even better results.
