            Ely Wellbeing is a training centre and therapy hub where people learn the skillsets of
NLP not only to improve their lives. They can also start a business and play an
integral role in helping others in their personal and business lives. We are different
and as such one of our modalities to enhance lives is through Ballroom Dancing as
we believe that life is a dance. <br><br> As a competitive dancer, I quickly discovered that
dancing is a physical display of what is going on in the dancer&#39;s inner world. Unlike
golf, a totally individualised sport ballroom dancing requires you interacting with
another person (your teammate). It personifies life in that although you have to be
the best version of you to navigate and enjoy life, you also have to interact effectively
with the world and the people within it. <br><br>Through our courses, you&#39;ll gain the skills
sets, and with enough practice, you can master them. Alternatively, engage with us
and allow us to facilitate positive change in your life through one or more of our
numerous modalities.
