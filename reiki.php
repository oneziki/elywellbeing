They gently place their palms, non-intrusively, on or near the body. There’s no massage or manipulation in Reiki since they treat the whole individual quite than specialising in specific signs. The Reiki practitioner will typically change the position of their hands several times throughout remedy, that sufferers keep absolutely clothed.
