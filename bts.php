            <p class="card-text">
               An NLP personal breakthrough session may be a super-charged intensive 1 day
               personal or professional Coaching session designed to satisfy your specific
               needs and make the momentum needed to expedite you realising your goals These
               highly client-centred personal development sessions work on whatever personal or
               professional changes you would like to form within the first stages you&#39;re asked many inquiries to uncover and illuminate pertinent
               issues; several which can not are apparent to you! Once the root causes of any self-
               limiting belief of experiencing a lull or rut or not being the person you envisaged to be
               are identified, we eliminate them.
               <br><br>
               If you&#39;re reading this, there&#39;s a high likelihood that there&#39;s something unresolved or
               missing from your life. You&#39;ll not be quite satisfied in all areas of life and have a
               nagging repeating feeling that unless things change, your future will be similar to
               your past. A breakthrough session provides the impetus to fuel you into achieving a
               preferable future.

            <h4 class="card-title">How will a breakthrough session meet my expectations?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
               Having a breakthrough session may be a rapid way of getting your life back on
               track, and since the session takes several hours, an excellent sense of purpose is
               generated, and quantum leaps in your thinking appear. Unresolved issues are no
               longer presenting problems and are all addressed. There&#39;s a renewed sense of
               congruent confidence and empowerment alongside the motivation to
               manoeuvre your life within the direction you would like it to travel in. Clients notice
               major improvements in how they think and act they feel unburdened by doubts and
               anxieties.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4 class="card-title">Breakthrough sessions are particularly suitable for:</h4>
            <ul>
               <li>Depression</li>
               <li>Emotional challenges.</li>
               <li>Improving morale.</li>
               <li>Improving personal and professional advancement.</li>
               <li>Feelings of stagnation in any area of life: relationships health and well-being
                  spirituality.
               </li>
               <li>Developing a way of self-reliance, self-confidence self-acceptance motivation
                  and direction.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="card-text">
               A breakthrough session negates the necessity to attend to possess a series of
               sessions. With today&#39;s busy lifestyles and heavy workloads, it only requires at some
               point out for you to abandon all that hinders you. Employers are getting increasingly
               agreeable to permit their valued employees time to deal with that which holds them
               back.

            <h4 class="card-title">How does a breakthrough session work?</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
               We make use of the world&#39;s most popular and proven personal development mind
               technologies including neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) TimeLine Therapy™ and
               modern hypnosis language forms These techniques allow direct contact with the part
               of the mind that stores the memories and habits of our emotions –
               the unconscious. Clients enter the session conscious of their conscious values and
               beliefs about themselves; however, here we dig deeper, challenging deeply
               unconscious values that drive your thinking and behaviour. By facilitating congruency
               between your conscious and unconscious thought patterns, we are ready to
               figure towards your goal.
            </p>

            <h4 class="card-title">The Session</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
               The sessions are very personalised, and therefore nature and length can vary a
               breakthrough session is approximately 5-8 hours working one on one. After an
               initial call to debate what you would like from the session, we start the method with a
               group of questions designed to uproot your thoughts and feelings providing the
               underlying issues also like people who are surfacing When a comprehensive
               overview of the problems has been established, we start to eliminate them whilst
               always providing the mind with new resources and new perspectives; you gain
               clarity and luxuriate in &#39;aha&#39; moments! New strategies and achievable goals for the
               longer term are added to your tool-kit alongside the means to regulate future
               unhelpful emotions and reject them. Armed with the new outlook about yourself
               reinforced subconsciously, you&#39;ll have the chance to remember your old habits and
               limiting beliefs, casting them off knowing that you can achieve your highest
               aspirations.
            </p>

            <h4 class="card-title">Ongoing support</h4>
            <p class="card-text">
               Following the breakthrough session whilst you&#39;re experiencing changing beliefs and
               concepts there&#39;s an optional 30–60-minute phone support session available for up to
               three months after your breakthrough
