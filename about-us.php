            As a competitive dancer, Evan Jeposa quickly discovered that
				dancing is a physical display of what is going on in the dancer&#39;s inner world. Unlike
				golf, a totally individualised sport ballroom dancing requires you interacting with
				another person (your teammate). It personifies life in that although you have to be
				the best version of you to navigate and enjoy life, you also have to interact effectively
				with the world and the people within it.<br><br>
