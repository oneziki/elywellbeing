               <h3 class="subheading">4. Emotional Freedom Techniques — EFT</h3>
               <p>
               EFT — sometimes mentioned as Energy Tapping — may be a complete bundle of
               techniques that NLP Master Practitioner Gary Craig created. Designed to create an
               equilibrium in the body&#39;s energy system, EFT removes the consequences of
               obstructive emotions, physical pain, and addictive cravings, like those from
               cigarettes, alcohol and medicines. EFT is predicated on an equivalent scientifically
               proven principles as acupuncture but is straightforward to apply by only tapping on
               parts of your body. This is often an incredible tool to use and show to your clients for
               even better results.

               Newsweek recently put it bluntly once they said, &quot;Need a life? Get a teacher,&quot; and
